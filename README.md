Sure, let's go through the code step by step:

sub = {}: This line initializes an empty dictionary sub. This dictionary is used to keep track of the most recent index where each character appeared in the string s.

cur_sub_start = 0: This variable cur_sub_start keeps track of the starting index of the current substring being considered.

cur_len = 0: This variable cur_len keeps track of the length of the current substring being considered.

longest = 0: This variable longest keeps track of the length of the longest substring without repeating characters found so far.

The for loop iterates through each index i and character letter in the string s.

if letter in sub and sub[letter] >= cur_sub_start:: This condition checks if the current character letter has been encountered before and its last occurrence is after or at the current substring's starting index cur_sub_start. If it's true, it means that the current character letter is repeating in the current substring.

cur_sub_start = sub[letter] + 1: If the current character letter is repeating, we update the cur_sub_start to the index next to the last occurrence of letter. This is because we want to exclude the previous occurrence of letter from the current substring.

cur_len = i - sub[letter]: After updating cur_sub_start, we calculate the length of the current substring by subtracting the index of the last occurrence of letter from the current index i.

sub[letter] = i: We update the dictionary sub with the most recent index of the current character letter.

else:: If the current character letter is not repeating in the current substring, we execute the code inside this block.

sub[letter] = i: We update the dictionary sub with the most recent index of the current character letter.

cur_len = cur_len + 1: We increment the length of the current substring by 1 since we have encountered a new character.

if cur_len > longest:: We check if the length of the current substring is greater than the length of the longest substring found so far.

longest = cur_len: If the current substring is longer than the longest substring found so far, we update the variable longest with the length of the current substring.

Finally, the return longest statement returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters found in the input string s.
